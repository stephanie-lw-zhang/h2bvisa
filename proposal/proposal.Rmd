## Section 1. Introduction
Our general research question is: what factors make companies more likely to get successfully obtain H2-B visas? 

For context, an H2-B visa is a temporary work visa for foreign workers with a job offer for seasonal, non-agricultural work in the United States. Employers from the United States must first submit temporary labor certification applications to the Department of Labor to allow H-2B workers to apply for visas. (Source: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services)

The dataset we are using is from the Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The data comes from H-2B applications that have been received and entered into the Department of Labor Tracking system. Specific information in the dataset about the employers was gathered through the foreign labor certification applications employers submitted. Data relating to wage levels was provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics Program. 

The data is sorted by fiscal year, from 2000 to 2013. Each observation is a different petition filed by an employer. The variables in the dataset are as follows: 
*CASE_NUMBER
    *DECISION_DATE
    *NPC_SUBMITTED_DATE
