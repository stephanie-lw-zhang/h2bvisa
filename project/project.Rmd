### Background

### Data Manipulation
```{r - muate_benefits}

h2b_pay_diff <- h2b %>%
  mutate(wage_diff = case_when(
  PREVAILING_WAGE > BASIC_RATE_OF_PAY ~ "prevail_higher",
  PREVAILING_WAGE == BASIC_RATE_OF_PAY ~ "same",
  PREVAILING_WAGE < BASIC_RATE_OF_PAY ~ "basic_higher"
  ))
  
```


```{r - mutate_season}

```


### Visualizations

### Hypothesis Tests

### Regression Model

Your project goes here! Before you submit, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`. 

You can add sections as you see fit. Make sure you have a section called Introduction at the beginning and a section called Conclusion at the end. The rest is up to you!
